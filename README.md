# order-summary-component-main

This is a no-tutorial attempt at building the order summary component from frontendmentor.io. 
The challenge can be found at https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj.

I'm using SCSS and compiling using the Live Sass Compiler/Live Server extension in VS Code.
