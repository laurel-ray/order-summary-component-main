## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SCSS


### What I learned

I learned how to use the @use rule instead of @import. 
I had a lot of trouble getting this project started without the help of a tutorial leading me in the setup, but I managed to finally get it going using docs and code from my other projects.  

### Continued development

My biggest struggle is using terminal to set up an npm package to compile css. I spent any free moment I had to try to get it going and kept running into problems, so I gave up and just used the Live Sass Compiler and Live Server extensions in VS code. This is an area I need to work on. I also need way more practice using git and github and learning which files should be left out of the repository.

I also need more work on file structure, class naming (trying to use BEM), and DRY principles. 

### Useful resources

- [This article](https://stefaniefluin.medium.com/the-new-sass-module-system-out-with-import-in-with-use-e1bd8ba032d0) helped me figure out how to use the @use rule without having to re-name all of my variables.
- [This](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) is where I learned CSS and SCSS.
